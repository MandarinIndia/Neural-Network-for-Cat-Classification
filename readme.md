# Cat Image Classification Neural Network

A from scratch neural network for classifying cat images using deep learning.

## Introduction

This project is a  example of building a neural network to classify cat images. The neural network is trained on a dataset of labeled cat and non-cat images.

## Features

- Image Classification: Classifies images as "cat" or "not cat."
- Pre-trained Model: A pre-trained model is included for quick inference.
- Custom Training: Includes scripts to train the network on a custom dataset.

## About

The core functions required for building and training the neural network are implemented in the utils.py file. These functions are then called with the appropriate arguments in the dnn.ipynb Jupyter notebook, where the complete workflow is demonstrated, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Output of the model

- The model achieves an accuracy of 80% on the test dataset.
